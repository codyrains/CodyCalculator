# CodyCalculator

A calculator application that allows the user to add, subtract, multiply or divide two integers and return the correct value.

Requirements list:

1. A master loop around the calculator itself, allowing the user to repeatedly interact with it or quit the application.
2. Created an additional class (CalculatorExtensions.cs) that program.cs inherits from. The default ReadLine reads a string input. This method only allows integers, and will tell the user to enter an integer only if they enter a letter or other character.
3. Calculated and displayed data to get the current date and display the amount of days since/until a specific date.
